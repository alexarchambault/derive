# derive

*Utilities to derive type classes with shapeless*

Various type classes to help deriving type classes
with [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless).
Used by [case-app](https://github.com/alexarchambault/case-app)
and [argonaut-shapeless](https://github.com/alexarchambault/argonaut-shapeless) (or soon to be so).

Use it by adding to `build.sbt`,
```scala
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")
libraryDependencies += "com.github.alexarchambault" %% "derive" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

See the various type classes it provides in the `derive` namespace then.
